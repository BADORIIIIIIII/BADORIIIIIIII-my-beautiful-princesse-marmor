I hope you like this... I just wanted to let you know how much I love you, my love.
I'm so grateful to have such a beautiful girl like you — you changed my life for the better from the moment you walked in.
You became my soul, and now you're something I can’t live without.

My love for you grows with every second we talk, with every thought I have of you.
I thank God every day for sending a sweet, beautiful angel like you into my life.

I love spending time with you, even if it's just through the phone — I truly cherish every moment.
Inshallah, in a few years, we’ll finally be together in person and get to do all the things we planned.

I want to have some beautiful kids — just like you.
I can’t imagine life without you.
I want to spend my whole life with you, under your wings and in your arms.

You became my soul that I can’t live without. When I imagine something, you have to be there — I can’t see a future without you in it. 
May Allah keep you in my life forever.
I love you so much, Maria, and I’ll love you until my very last heartbeat.
